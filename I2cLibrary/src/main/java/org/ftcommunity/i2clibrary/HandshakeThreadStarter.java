/**
 * A class that helps us start a thread and interlock with its actual starting up.
 * <p>
 * It's surprisingly often that in order to be able to correctly shut down a thread after
 * it has begun, or to give the thread the opportunity to acquire resources it needs to operate,
 * that one shouldn't return from the logic that 'starts' the thread until the thread has
 * begun execution and positively indicated that it's good to go.
 * <p>
 * This class helps to implement that handshake logic.
 * <p>
 * That all said, this class is probably less useful than we initially thought it would be.
 * And its implementation should be cleaned up to use ExecutorService's.
